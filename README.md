## Description
This application is run in our terminal and can generate a simple logo with just 4 prompts.  You can also run tests on the shape classes to make sure you are getting the shape you want before running the program. 

### Dependencies
[![node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-43853D?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)

### Installing
No install needed, just clone the code and go!

### Running
run node index.js to initialize the prompts and watch it go! You can also run the testing blocks with "npm test".

## Help
You may not enter more than 3 letters, also the color input works but is picky about exact hex values so be careful. Once you enter you cannot go back.
