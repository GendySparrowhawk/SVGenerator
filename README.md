## Description
This application is run in our terminal and can generate a simple logo with just 4 prompts.  You can also run tests on the shape classes to make sure you are getting the shape you want before running the program. 

### Dependencies
Jest, node.JS and Inquirer will all need to be installed to run this program.

### Installing
No install needed, just clone the code and go!

### Executing program
run node index.js to initialize the prompts and watch it go! You can also run the testing blocks with "npm test".

## Help
You may not enter more than 3 letters, also the color input works but is picky about exact hex values so be careful. Once you enter you cannot go back.
